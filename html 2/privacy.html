                We hope that every trip you book through the Aamcha Auto goes without issue but we
                understand that sometimes things happen. If a trip you take does not meet your expectations,
                you can share your feedback by rating your driver in the app and if you believe there was an
                error with your price or a more serious issue occurred on your trip, you can report it to our
                Support team. In some cases, your report may be covered by our Rider Refund Policy.
                We want you to know what to expect when you report issues, so we are sharing examples of
                when you may be eligible to receive a full or partial refund of the price you paid. If you have an
                issue on a trip, let us know within 30 days. All requests will be evaluated at Aamcha Auto’s sole
                discretion, and on a case-by-case basis.
                As a rider, its your responsibility to check the information provided is accurate and meets your
                expectations of quality. If you decide to take a trip, you are accepting the terms of service and
                are taking responsibility for the successful payment of that trip.
